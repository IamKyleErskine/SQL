#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

#First I familiarized myself with some of the data and how the tables were setup within the database.

SELECT * from BIT_DB.customers

SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
    LIMIT 20;

#Then I began querying the data to answer specific questions.

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT Count(*) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;
#A: 9723

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT Count(*) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
    WHERE product = "iPhone";
#A: 379

#3. Which product was the cheapest sold in January, and for what price?
SELECT distinct MIN(price), product FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;
#A: AAA Batteries (4Pack) for 2.99

#4. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(Quantity)*price as Revenue, product FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
    GROUP BY product;
    
#5. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?    
SELECT SUM(Quantity), product, SUM(Quantity)*price as Revenue FROM BIT_DB.FebSales    
    WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
    GROUP BY product;
    
#6. In February, how many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?     
SELECT COUNT(cust.acctnum), AVG(quantity*price) FROM BIT_DB.FebSales FEB
    LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers Cust
    ON FEB.orderid = Cust.order_id
    WHERE Feb.Quantity>2;
    #A: 890 customers with an avg of 4.17 spent
    
#7. List all of the products sold in Los Angeles in February and include how many of each were sold.

#11. What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February?
SELECT SUM(quantity)/COUNT(cust.acctnum) FROM BIT_db.FebSales Feb
    LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust

#12. Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?
