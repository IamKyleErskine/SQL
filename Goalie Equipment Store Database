--Project goal: 
--Create a store database selling one type of thing that your store specializes in. 
--You should have a table for your store with at least 5 columns for the kind of data you think you'd need to store. 
--You should sell at least 15 items, and use select statements to order your items by price and show at least one statistic about the items.
