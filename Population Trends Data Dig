--In this syntax I explore data about the world population as of 2020.

--Countries and dependent territories, 2020
--Data adapted from
--http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/
--Does not include rows which had "N.A." values, so some territories are missing.

--First let's see the average total population of all the countries and round it to the nearest whole number.
SELECT 
    ROUND(AVG(population))
FROM countries;

--Now how about we see what countries have a popluation below that average.
SELECT 
    name
FROM countries
    WHERE population < 38774455;
    
--That's quite a list, let's count how many there are.
SELECT 
    COUNT(name)
FROM countries
    WHERE population < 38774455;
    
--Now how many countries are above the average?
SELECT 
    COUNT(name)
FROM countries
    WHERE population > 38774455;
    
--Which country has the largest population?
SELECT 
    name, 
    MAX(population)
FROM countries;

--And which country has the lowest population?
SELECT
    name, 
    MIN(population)
FROM countries;

--How many natives are adding to the highest populated country?
SELECT
    name,
    MAX(population),
    fertility_rate
FROM countries;

--And the lowest?
SELECT
    name, 
    MIN(population),
    fertility_rate
FROM countries;
