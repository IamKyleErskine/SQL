# This is Kyle Erskine's SQL Syntax Portfolio

## Welcome to my SQL Portfolio! This code repository contains examples of SQL syntax I've personally written. Feel free to take a look and reach out via email if you have any questions: kyle.erskine01@gmail.com
## These works have been completed through lessons on Khan Academy and with Charlotte Chaze's "How to Break Into Tech" SQL and Tableau online course. Thank you Charlotte for having this course available and helping me learn these new skills!
