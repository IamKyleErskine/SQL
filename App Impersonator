--In this project I made a small dataset that would be the basics behind character logs for a videogame.--

CREATE TABLE warriors (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT,
    level INTEGER,
    class TEXT);
    
INSERT INTO warriors (name, level, class) VALUES ("leroy jenkins", 5, "paladin");
INSERT INTO warriors (name, level, class) VALUES ("ninja", 4, "rogue");
INSERT INTO warriors (name, level, class) VALUES ("dr lupo", 5, "wizard");
INSERT INTO warriors (name, level, class) VALUES ("tim tatman", 3, "tank");

--Then we altered the data to include more detail.--
ALTER TABLE warriors ADD title TEXT;

UPDATE warriors SET title = "master" WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE warriors SET title = "apprentice" WHERE id = 2;
UPDATE warriors SET title = "grandmaster" WHERE id = 3;
UPDATE warriors SET title = "intermediate" WHERE id = 4;

--Quick check to make sure everything is updated correctly.--
SELECT * FROM warriors;

--Look we have a new player! Their data is input as the most current.--
INSERT INTO warriors (name, level, class, title) VALUES ("dr disrespect", 5, "dps", "master");

SELECT * FROM warriors;

--Let's add another stat to track within our videogame. This one we can use with advertisers so we can get paid for the time we've put into this project since it
was released for free.--
ALTER TABLE warriors ADD days_played INTEGER;

SELECT * FROM warriors;

UPDATE warriors SET days_played = 2 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE warriors SET days_played = 3 WHERE id = 2;
UPDATE warriors SET days_played = 1 WHERE id = 3;
UPDATE warriors SET days_played = 4 WHERE id = 4;
UPDATE warriors SET days_played = 3 WHERE id = 5;

--Double check again to make sure everything was updated accordingly.--
SELECT * FROM warriors;

--As is normal with the eb and flow of videogames we've had our first player drop off and quit the game.--
DELETE FROM warriors WHERE id = 1;

SELECT * FROM warriors;
